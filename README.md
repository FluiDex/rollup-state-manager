# Rollup State Manager

This is the offline operator node used by FluiDex (a ZK-Rollup Layer2 DEX on Ethereum).   

The operator node collects Layer-2 transactions, updates rollup states, and produces Layer-2 blocks, then submits these Layer-2 blocks onto the Ethereum blockchain. `Operator` can also be called sequencer/validator.
